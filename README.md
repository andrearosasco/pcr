# Point Cloud Reconstruction (Paper)
This branch aims to train, improve and compare with other models our shape reconstruction
architecture to the purpose of publishing a paper.
The experiments will be mostly conducting on ShapeNetPOV. A version of ShapeNet that we 
defined to test reconstruction under self-obstruction.
